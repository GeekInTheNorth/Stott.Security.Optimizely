# Contributing

I am open to contributions to the code base. The following rules should be followed:

1. Contributions should be made by Pull Requests targeting the `develop` branch.
2. All commits should have a meaningful messages.
3. All commits should have a reference to your GitHub user.
4. Ideally all new changes should include appropriate unit test coverage.
